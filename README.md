# User Stories
As a fan of speedrunning, I want to see the newest runs from my favorite players
As a follower of many speedrunners, I need a way to see the most recent submissions from my favorite runners
As a fan of many runners, I need a way to recall my favorites on demand
As a bad speedrunner, I need inspirational quotes


# The Goal
A user should be able to search for an SRC user
A user should be able to add a user to their favorites
A user should be able to recall their favorites from local storage
Users should receive inspiration quotes on search

# How does it work?
The search function will bring up the 5 most recent runs for a user.
If a user has fewer than 5 submitted runs, it will return all runs
Users can save a runner as a favorite which will create a button
If the button is clicked, the search can be rerun at any time
Inspirational quotes will populate on search
